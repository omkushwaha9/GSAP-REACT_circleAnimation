<h2>
About this project
</h2>

This project is developed using React and incorporates GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) for creating sophisticated animations. The core feature of this project is an interactive button positioned at the center of the screen. Upon pressing this button, a circle begins to move dynamically across the screen along the x-axis, covering various random positions within the viewport.

The movement of the circle is achieved through the utilization of GSAP's powerful animation capabilities. Specifically, the Random utility provided by GSAP is employed to determine random coordinates, thereby enabling the circle to relocate to arbitrary addresses within the screen's boundaries. This results in a visually engaging and unpredictable animation pattern, enhancing the interactive experience for users.

The integration of React with GSAP allows for seamless updates and re-renders, ensuring that the animations remain smooth and responsive. By leveraging these technologies, the project not only demonstrates advanced animation techniques but also exemplifies the synergy between modern JavaScript frameworks and animation libraries in creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
